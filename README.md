The repo includes the python code "Blog Post - Crypto Prices and Market Efficiency.py" that generates the three charts in the blog post. 

The code needs the time series of market cap of all cryptos (crypto_mktcap.csv) and the market cap of bitcoin (bitcoin_mktcap.csv). 

The output of the code is figure1.png (the time series market cap of all cryptos), figure2.png (correlation between sp500 returns and crypto returns), and figure3.png (a scatter plot of selected Nasdaq100 firms, ETH, BTC, and commodities).
